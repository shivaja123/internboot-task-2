ðŸ”¹ Steps for Task 2: Regularized Regression

Prepare Data

Select features (store_nbr, onpromotion, family, etc.).

Encode categorical variables (family, store_nbr).

Split into train/test sets.

Baseline Model

Train a Linear Regression as a baseline.

Ridge & Lasso Regression

Train with Ridge and Lasso.

Tune the regularization parameter alpha.

Model Comparison

Compare RÂ², MAE, RMSE across models.

Check coefficients.

Feature Importance

In Lasso, coefficients can shrink to 0 â†’ helps identify important features.

Plot feature weights.
